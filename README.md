# Physifix

Physifix treats your aches and pains with curated diagnostics & exercises. 

# Features

- An interactive human model (only the rear hips & lower back have content at the moment)
- Curated diagnostics & videos
- OAuth (Although there is no benefit at the moment to signing in)

# Known bugs

- Halves of both bodies don't work: The SVG representing the front & rear human models uses a transformation of the complete image on one side to produce the picture of the other half. Unfortunately, this means that copied half isn't interactive. When we have the time, this will be fixed.

# Future features:

- Bookmarking diagnostic videos
- Rating diagnostic videos
- Recommendations based on diagnostics
- More content for common injuries (shoulders, knees, ankles)
